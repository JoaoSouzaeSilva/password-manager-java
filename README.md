# password-manager-java

DISCLAIMER: This is not a true password manager and has ZERO security features. Do NOT use it to store any passwords.

This is my first personal project, and I think it's a good starting point for those who are trying to find projects to work on. By working on this project, you also practice reading and understanding someone else's code, which may not necessarily be well written! Hopefully, mine is okay.

Some things you can do include, but are not limited to:

| Estimated difficulty | Task |
| :------------------- | :--- |
|Easy                  |Modify the UI.|
|Easy                  |Investigate how things are handled when we have a multiple InternetAccounts with the same domain and optimize.|
|Easy/Medium           |Look around and fix any bugs.|
|Medium                |As of now, when we press the close button (the x button the top corners), the parent pane remains disabled. Fix this.|
|Medium                |Add a feature that allows users to delete domains from the password manager.|
|Medium                |Add a feature that allows users to delete their account from the password manager.|
|Medium                |Add a feature that allows users to change their login password.|
|Medium                |Add a feature that allows users to change their domains/usernames/passwords for each InternetAccount.|
|Medium                |Add a sort feature for the domains, i.e. A-Z and Z-A.|
|Medium                |Launch the default browser when user clicks on the password domain and open the website.
|Hard                  |Add animations to UI.|
