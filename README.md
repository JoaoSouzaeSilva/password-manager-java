# password-manager-java

DISCLAIMER: This is not a true password manager and has ZERO security features. Do NOT use it to store any passwords.

This is my first personal project, and I think it's a good starting point for those who are trying to find projects to work on.

Things you can do include, but are not limited to:

| Estimated difficulty | Task |
| :------------------- | :--- |
|Easy                  |Modify the UI.|
|Easy                  |Investigate how things are handled when we have a multiple InternetAccounts with the same domain and optimize.|
|Medium                |Add a feature that allows users to delete InternetAccounts from the password manager.|
|Medium                |Add a sort feature to the domains, i.e. A-Z and Z-A.|
|Medium                |Add animations to UI.|
|Hard                  |Instead of using .txt files, use a data base to store all the info.|
|Super Hard            |Implement security features.|
